<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Yunlong Lin, a Master student at Xiamen University (XMU) @[SmartDSP](https://xmu-smartdsp.github.io/) advised by [Prof. Xinghao Ding](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=k5hVBfMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My primary research interests include computer vision and deep learning, mainly focusing on reversible imaging problems and image generation.
